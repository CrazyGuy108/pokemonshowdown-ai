# Pokemon Showdown AI
Just a little project with the end goal of creating a bot that can make smart decisions during a Pokemon battle.
My current goal for now is to have it play in Generation 4.
The code is pretty unstable right now so I wouldn't recommend trying to use it out of the box.

## Compiling/running
```sh
# compiles everything
npm install
npm run build
# directly execute the program
node dist/index.js

# compiles and runs
npm run main
```
